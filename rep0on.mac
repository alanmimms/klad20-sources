SUBTTL	MISCELANEOUS FOOLISHNESS

REPEAT 0,<

	IN ORDER TO ASSEMBLE DDDLH, THE PDP11 PROGRAM "LOAD11.P11"
(SEE TWO PAGES UP IN THE LISTING) MUST BE ASSEMBLED.  THE LISTING OUTPUT
OF THE MACY11 ASSEMBLER IS CONVERTED TO PDP10 CODE BY THE COBOL PROGRAM
"HACK11.CBL" (NEXT TWO PAGES).  THE EXACT PROCESS IS NOT TOO STRAIGHT-
FORWARD BUT THE BATCH CONTROL FILE "DDDLHB.CTL" DOES THE WHOLE JOB
AUTOMATICALLY.
