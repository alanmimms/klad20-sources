! This file will attempt to give a reader an overview of process one
! should go thru to produce released diagnostic.
!
! Basically there are two types of diagnostics STAND ALONE or USER MODE.

! STAND ALONE diagnostic should run with .A10 file format. To create
  .A10 file do as follow:

  1) Assemble all the source modules,
  2) Link or Compile all the source modules to create .SAV file,
  3) Run CONVRT program to produce .A10 file (input file .SAV ),
  
! Here is an example of what just explained above.

! DFCIA.CTL
!
! This command file is  used to assemble  all of the  source
! files necessary to produce DFCIA.SAV.  The approximate CPU
! time necessary to execute this batch job  is  30  minutes.
! About 4000 pages  of disk space  are needed excluding  the
! source files.

@Define DSK: DSK:,<CUSP10>		!Get CONVRT, *.KLM
@Define LPT: DSK:			!CREF output to disk

! Compile sources only if needed

CIAT::
@Compile /Cref DFCIAT+PARAM.KLM+FIXED.KLM+DFCIAE DFCIAT
@CREF
@Expunge
CIA1::
@Compile /Cref DFCIA1

CIA2::

CIAI::
@Compile /Cref DFCIAI
@CREF

CIAU::
@Compile /Cref DFCIAU

! Load and make .SAV and .A10 files

SAVE::
@R LINK
*DFCIAT,DFCIA/MAP/GO
@CSAVE DFCIA.SAV
@CONVRT
*DFCIA.SAV
@Expunge

! USER MODE diagnostic should run with .EXE file or .SAV file. To create
! .EXE file do step 1 and 2 from above (STAND ALONE). To create .SAV
! file do step 1 and 2 (specify switch S in step 2) frm above.

! All the diagnostics must be accompany with .SEQ file. This file is a
! user readable listing of diagnostic with cref,symbol table, text file
! and history file. To create .SEQ do as follow:

  1) Specify switch cref at compilation time to create .CRF file,
  2) Run CREF program to produce .LST file,
  3) Run DECDOC program to produce .SEQ file (input file .LST).

! Example continue 
!------------------
!
! Append listings together

APP::
@Delete DFCIA.LST
@Expunge
@APPEND DFCIAT.LST,DFCIA1.LST,DFCIA2.LST,DFCIA3.LST,DFCIA4.LST DFCIA.LST
@APPEND DFCIA5.LST,DFCIAI.LST,DFCIAU.LST DFCIA.LST


! Create .SEQ file

DOC::
@RU DECDOC
*DFCIA
@START
*DFCIA/S=DFCIA.TXT,DFCIA.HST,DFCIA.DOC,DFCIA.LST,DFCIA.MAP
@
@Delete DFCIA.LST
@Expunge

! At this point you should have .SEQ file and should be asking where
! are those utility program that I need ? All of the diagnostic utility
! programs are located on diagnostic structure in the <CUSP10> area.

! Now you are ready to make a release tape using a MAGTAP utility.
! Create .INP file and use it to MAKE the diagnostic tape. 
!
! For example at MAGTAP COMMAND prompt simply type MAKE @DFCIA.INP to
! make DFCIA diagnostic tape.

! The diagnostic tape should contain all the files specify in the .INP
! file. The .INP file must be in the following format. A copy of this
! file is in the <LATEST> area as BLANK.INP. To create .INP file for a 
! particular diagnostic simply type in file name for the lable BLANK.

;THIS FILE IS USED TO GENERATE 'INP' FILES WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF 
;ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS.
